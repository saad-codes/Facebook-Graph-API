# Facebook
This project is used to extract(my) data from Facebook Graph API. 
I have used 2 menthods in Python 

## Method 1
In this method I fetched Data using from graph API transformed the data from json to a list of lists, then send Data into Pandas data frame and saved it into the CSV file in my PC.
After that uploaded CSV from my PC and using Pyton I have sent that data from my PC to MySQL data base.
## Method 2 
In this method I fetched Data from Facebook Graph API and stroed that data into MySQL database directly. In this I have created tables in python and those tables are directly made in MySQL.
After that the data fetched from my userID I directly inserted data into the tables.
